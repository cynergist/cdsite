# Cyn's Blog

My personal site lives here. The `master` branch includes `src`, the `public` file contains pages on the blog.
I'm using the Lumen starter from Gatsby to practice React, but future plans include optimizations using ARIA for accessibility.

# Lumen

Lumen is a minimal, lightweight and mobile-first starter for creating blogs uses
[Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby).

This is a fork of
[gatsby-starter-lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen)
updated for Gatsby v2 by the team at
[GatsbyCentral](https://www.gatsbycentral.com/).
