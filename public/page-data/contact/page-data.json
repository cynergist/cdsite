There are a few reasons why this project was so informative. First, the exercise in building a shell in C did not allow use of C’s standard libraries.  This was an interesting challenge because, when I needed to, for example, copy a string of characters to a new destination, instead of using <code class=\"language-text\">strcpy</code> from the stdio.h or string.h libraries, I had to create custom functions that would do this for me. I probably wouldn’t make the choice to use my custom functions in a production-ready shell because I trust that the standard libraries include an optimized version of these functions. However, it was a useful exercise that helped me understand what is happening byte-by-byte when we have <code class=\"language-text\">argv</code> input from the command line and that input is tokenized and used to search the built-ins or PATH programs. </p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/c3a25aad468e25db6f9f49903fe7c00c/5058c/shell_snip.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 960px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 45.16129032258064%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"This screenshot shows the simple shell handling the commands: ls, pwd, git status, rm, and exit.\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/c3a25aad468e25db6f9f49903fe7c00c/b3ee8/shell_snip.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c3a25aad468e25db6f9f49903fe7c00c/3bc27/shell_snip.jpg 240w,\n/static/c3a25aad468e25db6f9f49903fe7c00c/98431/shell_snip.jpg 480w,\n/static/c3a25aad468e25db6f9f49903fe7c00c/b3ee8/shell_snip.jpg 960w,\n/static/c3a25aad468e25db6f9f49903fe7c00c/b97fe/shell_snip.jpg 1440w,\n/static/c3a25aad468e25db6f9f49903fe7c00c/fb329/shell_snip.jpg 1920w,\n/static/c3a25aad468e25db6f9f49903fe7c00c/5058c/shell_snip.jpg 2604w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>It is important to know how much memory is being called because there may be a circumstance where we’re asked to build hardware that has a limit on the amount of memory it can provide (theoretically!).
